  <h1 class='header'>About 5th Wall Productions</h1>
  <p>Started in 2010, 5th Wall has been producing intimate interactive theater experiences that are unique in the Los Angeles area. By breaking down the barrier between audiences and the scene, the viewing experience goes from passive to active. We have moved beyond the traditional concept of theater, with its proscenium arch and 4th wall mentality. In our productions, the audience is free to move among the scene, interacting with the set and with each other to create a full sensory experience. We hope you enjoy the show!</p>
